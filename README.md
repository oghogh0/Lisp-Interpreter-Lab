<h1>Lisp Interpreter Lab</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I have implemented an interpreter for a dialect of LISP. LISP is one of the earliest high-level programming languages, invented by MIT's John McCarthy in 1958. The LISP dialect implemented is similar to Python in a lot of ways and is Turing-complete. However, the LISP syntax is simpler than Python's.<br />

<h2>Languages and Environments Used</h2>
